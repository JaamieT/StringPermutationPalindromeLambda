Just testing out building a lambda function.
Lambda function that computes if a given string has any permutations that would be a palindrome.
Currently, it only accepts alphabetical characters (And will return false if any others exist), but it could be easily extended to accomdate all characters by adding values to a new dictionary instead of using a prebuilt one.

Note: This solution is wildy over engineered for such a simple problem, just used it as a test for building and deploying a lambda function!
